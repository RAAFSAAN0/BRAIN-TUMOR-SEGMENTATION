🧠 Comparative Analysis of U-Net Variants for Brain Tumor Segmentation
Evaluating Baseline 3D U-Net, Optimized 3D U-Net with Residual Blocks, and U-Net 3+ on the BraTS20 Dataset

📌 Overview
Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, enabling accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning models, particularly U-Net and its advanced variants, have revolutionized automated segmentation in medical imaging.

This research systematically evaluates three U-Net architectures:

🔹 Baseline 3D U-Net 🏗️ – A standard U-Net model known for its effectiveness in medical image segmentation.
🔹 Optimized 3D U-Net with Residual Blocks 🔄 – Enhances feature learning and gradient flow by incorporating residual connections.
🔹 U-Net 3+ ⚡ – Implements full-scale skip connections to improve multi-scale feature fusion and segmentation accuracy.

Using the BraTS20 dataset, we analyze segmentation accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness, measuring performance with:

✔ Dice loss
✔ Jaccard loss
✔ Mean IoU
✔ Precision
✔ Sensitivity
✔ Specificity
✔ Class-specific Dice coefficients
